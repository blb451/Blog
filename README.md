# CodeCore Blog Project

Primary Technologies: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery

This project was a simple blog app used for implementing and practicing the various skills taught to us throughout the bootcamp. After it's completion, I decided to follow up by implementing a few more features and took it as an opportunity to practice styling using pure CSS without any front-end framework.

Although there's still plenty of work to be done (and a lot of reformatting I could do in retrospect) I felt like this was a good place to stop my work on the blog and move on to other work.

This project is not moderated, and I am not responsible for any content that may appear here beyond the data seeded using the Faker gem.
